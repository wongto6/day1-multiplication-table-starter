O: I learnt context map and program design flow today.
We finished a few exercises on drawing context map and then using that context map for program development.
Excaldraw is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for drawing context map.

R: I think using context map is an effective way to facilitate program design and subsequent program development.


I: Drawing context map helps me to break down complicated problems into smaller and simpler problems to solve.

D: I will try to draw context map for my requirements and share it with my colleagues when I came back to work,
I think this will help me to achieve effective program design and implementation. Also, I believe concept map
can facilitate my communication with others regarding requirement analysis and execution.
